# EVA - Enhanced Virtual Assistant 
A real-time voice AI that can hear, see, understand, and control your computer — on any OS. Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Built on the Gemini Live API for native audio streaming, delivering zero subscriptions and total digital autonomy.

---

## ✨ Overview

EVA is where the assistant stops being a tool and starts being a presence. It remembers yesterday's conversation, watches the topics you care about, and speaks first when it has something worth saying. The goal of this build was continuity — EVA should feel like it never fully left, even after you close it.

It's not just an assistant — it's an extension of your digital life.

## 🆕 What's New in EVA

### 🗓️ Session Memory — EVA Remembers Yesterday
At the end of every session, EVA generates a 1-2 sentence summary of what was discussed and saves it to memory. The next morning, it's mentioned naturally in the briefing:
> *"Good morning, sir — it's 09:15. Yesterday you were working on the EVA background monitoring feature. Fetching today's headlines now."*

The summary is consumed immediately after use — it never repeats in future briefings and adds zero long-term bloat to memory.

### 👁️‍🗨️ Background Monitoring — EVA Watches While You're Away
Tell EVA to monitor any topic and it checks for new developments once a day using DuckDuckGo news. When a headline changes, it reports back naturally in your language:
> *"Efendim, takip ettiğiniz yapay zeka haberlerinde bir gelişme var: Google yeni bir model duyurdu."*

Fully opt-in — EVA monitors nothing without being explicitly asked. Crypto, financial, and trading topics are blocked at the code level regardless of what is requested. Same headline never triggers twice.

### 🔔 Proactive System 2.0 — Context-Aware, Time-Aware, Non-Repetitive
The proactive engine was rebuilt from the ground up. Instead of a generic check-in after 15 minutes of silence, EVA now:
- Knows the **time of day** — morning tone differs from evening tone
- Knows your **active projects** from memory and can ask how something is going
- Knows your **monitored topics** and can bring one up naturally
- Knows **what you were just talking about** (last 8 conversation turns)
- **Rotates** between three focus areas so it never opens with the same line twice
- Has a 20-minute cooldown (up from 10) — less intrusive, more meaningful

### 👁️ Instant Vision Acknowledgment — No More Silent Waiting
When you ask EVA to look at your screen or camera, it no longer goes silent while processing. It immediately says something natural ("Looking at your screen now, sir" / "Ekrana bakıyorum efendim") while the capture runs. The actual analysis follows as the next response.

### 📰 Parallel News Search — First Result Wins
News queries now run Gemini Grounded Search and DuckDuckGo news simultaneously in two threads. Whichever delivers a valid result first is used; the other is silently discarded. A Gemini 503 error no longer delays results — the DDG fallback is already running in parallel.
